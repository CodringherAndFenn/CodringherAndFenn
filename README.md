## 👀 A bit about me 👀

I am a 4th year Creative Media and Game Technologies (CMGT) student at the Hanze University of Apllied Sciences.
I am driven by a very strong passion for building and playing video-games, nurtured from a very young age.
The vast experience I gathered throughout my University years, ranging from Game Design, Programming, Project Management and Art, solidifed my belief of wanting to be part of a small to medium-sized game development studio.

## 🐱‍🏍 Young entrepreneur 🐱‍🏍
I was also the CEO and founder of KIBO Entertainment, an indie startup comprised of 4 people who worked on a 6 month project together. 
This amazing entrepreneurship experience gave me a unique view into the inner workings of a development studio, into how important good communication and cohesiveness is in any studio, and into just how much goes in coordinating so many people towards one singular goal.
